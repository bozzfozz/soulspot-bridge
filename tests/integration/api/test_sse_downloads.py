"""Enhanced integration tests for SSE (Server-Sent Events) download updates.

This module extends the existing SSE tests with comprehensive coverage of
download progress events, event structure validation, and error scenarios.
Tests verify that SSE properly streams real-time download updates to clients.
"""

# AI-Model: Copilot
# Hey future me - SSE tests are tricky because they test long-lived streaming connections!
# Use async_client.stream() context manager and iterate over lines with aiter_lines().
# Each SSE event ends with double newline (\n\n). Event format is text-based protocol:
# "event: type\ndata: json\n\n". Parse carefully! Mock download repository to control what
# events get sent. Test both successful scenarios and error handling (repo failures, client
# disconnect, malformed data). Remember: SSE is unidirectional (server -> client only).
