"""Spotify Image Service - Download and manage Spotify artwork locally.

Hey future me - this service handles LOCAL STORAGE of Spotify images!

Why local storage?
1. Offline access - Images work without Spotify connection
2. Fast loading - No CDN latency, images served from disk
3. URL change detection - Compare image_url vs stored; re-download if changed
4. Cleanup on delete - Remove images when entity is removed from DB

Image sizes (per user specification):
- Artists: 300x300px (profile images, smaller is fine)
- Albums: 500x500px (cover art, needs more detail)
- Playlists: 300x300px (grid thumbnails)

Format: WebP (30% smaller than JPEG, supported everywhere now)

Storage structure:
  artwork/
    spotify/
      artists/
        {spotify_id}.webp
      albums/
        {spotify_id}.webp
      playlists/
        {playlist_id}.webp

IMPORTANT: This service is for SPOTIFY SYNC images only!
The existing ArtworkService in postprocessing/ handles downloaded track artwork.
