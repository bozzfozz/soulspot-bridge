# Hey future me, AlbumCompletenessInfo is a data holder for album gap analysis! Tells you WHICH tracks are
# missing and calculates percentage (e.g., "you have 10 of 12 tracks = 83.3% complete"). The missing_track_numbers
# list is the actual gap - [3, 7] means track 3 and 7 are missing. Source tells you where we got the track count
# from (spotify vs musicbrainz - useful for debugging mismatches). This is pure data, no business logic!
