"""Service for syncing and managing individual songs (singles) from followed artists.

Hey future me - this service handles syncing songs that are NOT part of albums from
artists the user follows on Spotify. It fetches "top tracks" from Spotify (most popular
songs) and stores them as tracks without album association. This is separate from
album sync - we're handling standalone singles/popular tracks here!

The flow is:
1. Get followed artists from DB (already synced via FollowedArtistsService)
2. For each artist, fetch their top tracks from Spotify API
3. Filter out tracks that are part of albums (we only want singles)
4. Create/update Track entities in our DB
5. Return sync statistics

GOTCHA: Spotify's "top tracks" endpoint returns the artist's most popular songs,
which may include album tracks. We filter these by checking if the track's album
type is "single" or if the album has only one track.
