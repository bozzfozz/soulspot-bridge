    Hey future me - this is the SMART DOWNLOAD QUEUE feature! When user imports a playlist,
    they can auto-queue all missing tracks (tracks without file_path) for download. The
    quality_filter lets them choose: "flac" (lossless only), "320" (320kbps MP3+), or "any"
    (download whatever is available). This integrates with the existing JobQueue system that
    handles Soulseek downloads. The use case is idempotent - tracks already downloaded are
    skipped. Returns job IDs so UI can track download progress!
