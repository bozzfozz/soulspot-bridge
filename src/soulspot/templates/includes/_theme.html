{#
  Hey future me - LEGACY Theme Include
  
  This old harmony theme switcher is SUPERSEDED by:
  - /static/new-ui/css/variables.css (design tokens)
  - /static/new-ui/css/main.css (all styles)
  
  The new design system is dark-only (no light mode toggle).
  Colors are controlled via CSS custom properties in variables.css.
  
  Keeping this file for backward compatibility but it does nothing now.
#}

{# 
  DEPRECATED: Theme handling is now done via CSS variables.
  The new UI is dark-theme only. No toggling needed.
  
  If you need to customize colors, edit:
  /static/new-ui/css/variables.css
#}

<!-- Theme include deprecated - new design uses CSS variables in /static/new-ui/css/variables.css -->
