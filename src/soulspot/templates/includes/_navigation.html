{#
  Hey future me - LEGACY Navigation Include
  
  This old top-navigation is SUPERSEDED by:
  - includes/sidebar.html (new fixed sidebar)
  - base.html (with sidebar integration)
  
  Keeping this for any templates that might still reference it.
  The new design uses a sidebar, NOT a top navbar.
  
  If you're reading this, check if the template using this include
  has been migrated to extend base.html with the sidebar.

{# Legacy top navigation - kept for backward compatibility but essentially deprecated #}
{% macro main_nav(current_page='') %}
{# 
  DEPRECATED: Use the new sidebar system in base.html instead.
  This outputs nothing - the sidebar is now in includes/sidebar.html
  and automatically included by base.html.
#}
<!-- _navigation.html is deprecated. New sidebar-based navigation is in includes/sidebar.html -->
{% endmacro %}

{# Legacy nav item - no longer renders anything #}
{% macro nav_item(href, text, active=false, icon_path='') %}
{# DEPRECATED: Navigation items are now in sidebar.html using Font Awesome icons #}
{% endmacro %}

{# Legacy mobile nav item - no longer renders anything #}
{% macro mobile_nav_item(href, text, active=false, icon_path='') %}
{# DEPRECATED: Mobile nav is now handled by sidebar collapse in sidebar.html #}
{% endmacro %}
