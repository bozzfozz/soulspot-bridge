"""Artist songs (singles) management API endpoints.

This router handles syncing and managing individual songs from followed artists.
Unlike the album sync feature, this focuses on "top tracks" / singles that
aren't necessarily part of a full album. Users can:
1. Sync songs for a single artist (fetch top tracks from Spotify)
2. Sync songs for ALL followed artists (bulk operation)
3. List songs (singles) for an artist from our DB
4. Remove a specific song
5. Remove all songs for an artist

These are READ/WRITE operations that modify our tracks table, separate from the artists
and albums features. The tracks synced here have album_id = NULL (no album association).
