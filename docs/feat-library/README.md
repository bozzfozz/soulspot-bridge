| **Artist Management** | Add, edit, delete, monitor artists with MusicBrainz integration |
| **Album Management** | Track releases, editions, formats with monitoring controls |
| **Track Management** | Individual track handling with file mapping and metadata |
| **Quality Profiles** | Define preferred audio quality tiers and upgrade logic |
| **Organization** | Folder structure and file naming conventions |
| **Bulk Operations** | Mass edit, delete, organize across library |
| **Import/Export** | Manual import with preview, library export |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Understanding the Data Model

```
Artist (1) ──────< Album (N) ──────< Track (N)
   │                  │                 │
   │                  │                 │
   └── Statistics     └── Releases      └── TrackFile
       - albumCount       - editions        - path
       - trackCount       - formats         - quality
       - sizeOnDisk       - media           - size
```

### 2. Key Entities

| Entity | Purpose | Identifier |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Artist** | Music creator (solo/group) | MusicBrainz Artist ID |
| **Album** | Release container | MusicBrainz Release Group ID |
| **Track** | Individual song | MusicBrainz Recording ID |
| **TrackFile** | Physical audio file | Internal ID + file path |

### 3. Profile System

- **Quality Profile**: Defines acceptable audio formats (FLAC, MP3, etc.) and upgrade thresholds
- **Metadata Profile**: Controls which album types to include (Studio, EP, Single, Compilation)

## Feature Highlights

### Artist Management

```python
# Add artist workflow
1. Search by name or MusicBrainz ID
2. Select matching result
3. Configure:
   - Root folder path
   - Quality profile
   - Metadata profile
   - Monitoring options
4. System fetches albums and tracks from MusicBrainz
```

**Monitoring Options:**
- `None` — Don't monitor any albums
- `Specific Albums` — Choose which albums to monitor
- `All Albums` — Monitor entire discography
- `Future Albums` — Only monitor new releases

### Album Management

**Album Types:**
- Studio Album
- EP
- Single
- Compilation
- Live
- Remix
- Soundtrack
- Other

**Release Tracking:**
- Multiple releases per album (editions, remasters)
- Format tracking (CD, Vinyl, Digital)
- Country/region releases

### Quality System

```
Quality Tiers (Example):
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. FLAC (Lossless)      ← Cutoff   │
│ 2. ALAC (Lossless)                 │
│ 3. MP3-320                         │
│ 4. MP3-256                         │
│ 5. MP3-192                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

If current file is MP3-256, system will upgrade to FLAC when available.
```

### Library Views

| View | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Table** | Detailed rows with sortable columns | Power users, bulk operations |
| **Poster** | Grid of album/artist artwork | Visual browsing |
| **Banner** | Wide banner images | Artist overview |
| **Overview** | Compact list with descriptions | Quick scanning |

### Bulk Operations

- **Select Mode**: Toggle checkboxes for multi-select
- **Bulk Edit**: Change quality profile, tags, monitoring for multiple items
- **Bulk Delete**: Remove multiple items with file deletion option
- **Album Studio**: Quick album monitoring across entire library
