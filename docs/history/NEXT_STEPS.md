## What Needs to Be Done (Action Required) 🔴

### Step 1: Create GitHub Issues

You need to create 5 GitHub issues using the templates provided. Choose one of these methods:

#### Option A: Manual Creation (Recommended for First Time)
1. Open https://github.com/bozzfozz/soulspot/issues/new
2. For each issue in `docs/issues/spotify-auth-enhancements-issue-templates.md`:
   - Copy the **Title**
   - Copy the **Body** content
   - Add the **Labels** specified
   - Click "Submit new issue"
3. Note down the issue numbers (e.g., #42, #43, #44, #45, #46)

#### Option B: Using GitHub CLI (Faster)
If you're authenticated with `gh`, run these commands:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/soulspot/soulspot

# Issue 1: Persistent Session Storage
gh issue create \
  --title "[v2.1/feature] Persistent Session Storage — Spotify Auth" \
  --body-file <(sed -n '/^## Issue 1:/,/^## Issue 2:/p' docs/issues/spotify-auth-enhancements-issue-templates.md | head -n -1 | tail -n +3) \
  --label "enhancement,roadmap,auth,v2.1,session-management,priority:P1"

# Issue 2: Token Encryption
gh issue create \
  --title "[v2.1/feature] Token Encryption — Spotify Auth" \
  --body-file <(sed -n '/^## Issue 2:/,/^## Issue 3:/p' docs/issues/spotify-auth-enhancements-issue-templates.md | head -n -1 | tail -n +3) \
  --label "enhancement,roadmap,auth,v2.1,security,priority:P1"

# Issue 3: Multi-User Support
gh issue create \
  --title "[v2.2/feature] Multi-User Support — Spotify Auth" \
  --body-file <(sed -n '/^## Issue 3:/,/^## Issue 4:/p' docs/issues/spotify-auth-enhancements-issue-templates.md | head -n -1 | tail -n +3) \
  --label "enhancement,roadmap,auth,v2.2,multi-user,breaking-change,priority:P2"

# Issue 4: Token Revocation
gh issue create \
  --title "[v2.1/feature] Token Revocation — Spotify Auth" \
  --body-file <(sed -n '/^## Issue 4:/,/^## Issue 5:/p' docs/issues/spotify-auth-enhancements-issue-templates.md | head -n -1 | tail -n +3) \
  --label "enhancement,roadmap,auth,v2.1,security,oauth,priority:P1"

# Issue 5: Session Monitoring
gh issue create \
  --title "[v2.2/feature] Session Monitoring — Spotify Auth" \
  --body-file <(sed -n '/^## Issue 5:/,/^## How to Use/p' docs/issues/spotify-auth-enhancements-issue-templates.md | head -n -1 | tail -n +3) \
  --label "enhancement,roadmap,auth,v2.2,session-management,analytics,security,priority:P2"
```

### Step 2: Update Roadmap with Issue Numbers

After creating the issues, update the roadmap to link them:

1. Edit `docs/development-roadmap.md`
2. Find section 7.9 (around line 615, 620, 625, 630, 635)
3. Replace each `- Issue: TBD` with `- Issue: #XX` (where XX is the issue number)

Example:
```diff
| **1. Persistent Session Storage** | MEDIUM | P1 | v2.1 | Small (2-3 days) |
| - Current: In-memory sessions (lost on restart) | | | | |
| - Future: Redis or database-backed sessions | | | | |
| - Benefit: Sessions survive application restarts | | | | |
- | - Issue: TBD | | | | |
+ | - Issue: #42 | | | | |
```
