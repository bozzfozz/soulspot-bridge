## 📋 Default Policies & Configuration Recommendations

*(Source: soulspot-ideas.md - Section 4)*

### Rate Limiting & External API Policies
- **MusicBrainz:** 1 request/second (strict rate limiting, use worker queue)
- **Spotify API:** Respect rate limits, implement exponential backoff
- **slskd API:** Configurable concurrent requests (default: 2-3)

### Metadata Merge Priority
**Recommended hierarchy:**
1. Manual user edits (highest priority)
2. MusicBrainz (authoritative for classical metadata)
3. Discogs (good for release details)
4. Spotify (good for popularity and modern metadata)
5. Last.fm (fallback)
6. File tags (lowest priority)

**Open Question:** Should Spotify be prioritized higher for certain fields like popularity or user-facing names?

### Download Policies
- **Default parallel downloads:** 2 (configurable 1-5)
- **Retry policy:** 3 retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **Default quality filter:** Minimum 128kbps (configurable)
- **Format preference:** FLAC > 320kbps MP3 > 256kbps > 192kbps

### Legal & Compliance
- **Legal opt-in:** Required before automated downloads
- **Audit logging:** All downloads logged with timestamp, source, user
- **Legal mode:** Optional restricted mode for compliance-focused deployments

### Storage & Organization
**Recommended folder structure:**
```
/music-library/
  /downloads/          # Temporary download location
  /sorting/            # Post-processing staging area
  /new-artists/        # Recently added artists
  /unknown-album/      # Files without album metadata
  /library/            # Final organized library
    /Artist Name/
      /Album Name (Year)/
        01 - Track.flac
        cover.jpg
```

## ❓ Open Questions & Decision Points

*(Source: soulspot-ideas.md - Section 4)*

### Technical Decisions Needed

1. **Ratings Sync Strategy**
   - Should initial sync be one-way (Plex→SoulSpot) or bidirectional?
   - How to handle rating conflicts between systems?
   - Which rating scale to use as canonical (5-star vs 10-point)?
   - **Recommendation:** Start with one-way, evolve to bidirectional after testing

2. **Audio Fingerprinting Timeline**
   - Should AcoustID/Chromaprint be Phase 7 or Phase 8/9?
   - Significant complexity and performance impact
   - **Recommendation:** Phase 8 (Advanced Features) with opt-in flag

3. **Metadata Priority for Specific Fields**
   - Should Spotify be prioritized for popularity, modern artist names, or user-facing data?
   - How to handle conflicts between MusicBrainz canonical names vs. Spotify user-friendly names?
   - **Recommendation:** Configurable per-field priority, with sensible defaults

4. **Legal Mode Restrictions**
   - Which features should be restricted/disabled in legal mode?
   - How strict should automation be?
   - **Recommendation:** Define clear boundaries, document extensively, make opt-in explicit

5. **Plugin System Scope**
   - Full plugin system in Phase 8 or Phase 9?
   - Security implications of arbitrary plugins
   - **Recommendation:** Phase 9, with careful security review

6. **Multi-User Implementation**
   - Simple role-based access or full multi-tenancy?
   - Shared vs. private libraries?
   - **Recommendation:** Start with simple RBAC (admin/user), evolve based on demand

### Community Input Needed

These features should be discussed with users/contributors before implementation:
- [ ] Preferred default quality settings
- [ ] Folder structure preferences
- [ ] Rating sync behavior expectations
- [ ] Automation aggressiveness (how automatic should "auto" be?)
- [ ] Privacy expectations for metadata caching
- [ ] Acceptable external service dependencies
