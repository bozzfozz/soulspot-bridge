## How Authentication Works

### Token Storage

**Yes, all authentication tokens are stored server-side!**

- ✅ **Spotify OAuth tokens** (access + refresh tokens) are persisted in the SQLite database
- ✅ **Sessions survive server restarts** - no need to re-authenticate after updates/reboots
- ✅ **Automatic token refresh** - Spotify access tokens expire after 1 hour but are automatically renewed using the refresh token (no human interaction required)

### Authentication Methods

SoulSpot supports **two authentication methods**:

1. **Cookie-based (Default)** - Most secure, automatically managed by browser
2. **Bearer Token** - For API clients, curl, or cross-device access

---

## Single Device (Default)

### Initial Setup

1. **Start OAuth Flow**
   ```bash
   # Visit in your browser
   http://localhost:8000/api/auth/authorize
   ```

2. **Authorize with Spotify**
   - You'll be redirected to Spotify's authorization page
   - Grant permissions to SoulSpot
   - Automatically redirected back with tokens stored

3. **Session Cookie Set**
   - Browser automatically receives a `session_id` cookie (HttpOnly, Secure)
   - All subsequent API requests use this cookie for authentication
   - No manual token management required!

### Token Refresh (Automatic)

- Spotify access tokens expire after **1 hour**
- SoulSpot automatically refreshes tokens when needed
- **No human interaction required** - completely transparent
- Refresh tokens don't expire (unless revoked by Spotify)

---

## Multi-Device Access

### Use Cases

- Access SoulSpot from work laptop and home desktop
- Use API clients (curl, Postman, custom scripts) alongside web UI
- Share access with trusted household members (same Spotify account)

### Method 1: Export/Import Session (Browser)

**On Device A (where you're already authenticated):**

1. **Export your session ID**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/auth/session/export
   ```

   Response:
   ```json
   {
     "session_id": "your-session-id-here...",
     "created_at": "2025-11-24T12:00:00Z",
     "usage_instructions": {
       "curl": "curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer ...' ...",
       "browser": "Open DevTools → Application → Cookies → Set session_id",
       "api_clients": "Add header: Authorization: Bearer <session_id>"
     },
     "warning": "⚠️ Keep this session ID secret! It's equivalent to your password."
   }
   ```

2. **Copy the `session_id` value** (long random string)

**On Device B (new device):**

3. **Import the session**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/auth/session/import?import_session_id=YOUR_SESSION_ID_HERE"
   ```

   Or via browser:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application → Cookies
   - Add cookie: `session_id` = `<your-session-id>`
   - Set Domain: `localhost`, Path: `/`
   - Check HttpOnly ✓
   - Reload page - you're authenticated!

### Method 2: Bearer Token (API Clients)

Instead of importing the session as a cookie, you can use it directly via the `Authorization` header:

**Example: List playlists with curl**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SESSION_ID_HERE" \
     http://localhost:8000/api/playlists
```

**Example: Python script**
```python
import requests

session_id = "your-session-id-here"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {session_id}"}

# Get playlists
response = requests.get(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/playlists",
    headers=headers
)
print(response.json())

# Sync playlist
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/playlists/sync",
    headers=headers,
    json={"spotify_uri": "spotify:playlist:..."}
)
```

**Example: JavaScript fetch**
```javascript
const sessionId = "your-session-id-here";

fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/playlists", {
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${sessionId}`
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

## Security Best Practices

### ⚠️ Session ID is a Sensitive Credential

**The session ID is equivalent to your Spotify password for this application!**

### DO ✅

- **Use HTTPS in production** - Never send session IDs over unencrypted connections
- **Keep session IDs secret** - Treat them like passwords
- **Share only over secure channels** - Encrypted messaging, secure file sharing
- **Revoke compromised sessions** - Use `/api/auth/logout` if session ID is leaked
- **Use cookie-based auth when possible** - More secure than bearer tokens (HttpOnly protection)

### DON'T ❌

- **Don't commit session IDs to git** - Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
- **Don't share in public channels** - Slack, Discord, GitHub issues, etc.
- **Don't send via email/SMS** - Unencrypted and logged
- **Don't hardcode in scripts** - Use environment variables instead

### Recommended Practices

1. **Use environment variables**
   ```bash
   # .env file (never commit this!)
   SESSION_ID=your-session-id-here
   ```

   ```python
   import os
   session_id = os.environ["SESSION_ID"]
   ```

2. **Rotate sessions periodically**
   ```bash
   # Logout old session
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/logout

   # Re-authenticate
   # Visit http://localhost:8000/api/auth/authorize
   ```

3. **Monitor session activity**
   ```bash
   # Check current session info
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/auth/session
   ```

## API Usage Examples

### Check Authentication Status

```bash
# With cookie (browser)
curl -b cookies.txt http://localhost:8000/api/auth/session

# With bearer token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
     http://localhost:8000/api/auth/session
```

Response:
```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123...",
  "has_access_token": true,
  "has_refresh_token": true,
  "token_expired": false,
  "created_at": "2025-11-24T10:00:00Z",
  "last_accessed_at": "2025-11-24T12:30:00Z"
}
```

### Manual Token Refresh

Normally automatic, but you can trigger manually:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/auth/refresh
```

### Logout (Revoke Session)

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/auth/logout
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No session found" Error

**Cause:** Session ID missing or incorrect

**Solutions:**
1. Check cookie is set correctly (browser DevTools → Application → Cookies)
2. Verify Authorization header format: `Authorization: Bearer <session_id>`
3. Re-authenticate via `/api/auth/authorize`

### "Invalid or expired session" Error

**Cause:** Session expired due to inactivity or server restart (if not using DatabaseSessionStore)

**Solutions:**
1. Check session expiry: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/auth/session`
2. Re-import session if still valid on another device
3. Re-authenticate if session truly expired

### Token Refresh Fails

**Cause:** Refresh token invalid or revoked by Spotify

**Solutions:**
1. Check Spotify app permissions: https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/
2. Revoke and re-grant access to SoulSpot
3. Full re-authentication required (cannot recover from invalid refresh token)

### Session Doesn't Work on Device B

**Checklist:**
- ✅ Session ID copied correctly (no extra spaces/characters)
- ✅ Cookie domain matches (`localhost` or your domain)
- ✅ Cookie path is `/`
- ✅ HttpOnly flag set (for cookie-based)
- ✅ Network can reach server (check firewall, Docker port mapping)

### Bearer Token Works but Cookie Doesn't

**Cause:** Cookie security settings mismatch

**Solutions:**
1. Check `API_SECURE_COOKIES` setting in `.env`
   - `false` for HTTP (local development)
   - `true` for HTTPS (production)
2. Ensure browser and server domain match
3. Check SameSite policy allows cookies

---

## Production Deployment

### Required Settings

```bash
# .env (production)
API_SECURE_COOKIES=true  # Require HTTPS for cookies
API_SESSION_MAX_AGE=3600  # Session lifetime (seconds)
```

### HTTPS Setup

**Session IDs MUST be transmitted over HTTPS in production!**

Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik, Caddy) to terminate SSL:

```nginx
# nginx example
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name soulspot.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
    }
}
```

## FAQs

**Q: Do I need to re-authenticate after server restarts?**  
A: **No!** Sessions are persisted in SQLite database and survive restarts.

**Q: Can I access from my phone using the same session?**  
A: **Yes!** Export session from desktop, import on mobile browser or use bearer token in mobile app.

**Q: How long do sessions last?**  
A: Sessions are active as long as you use them. Default timeout is 1 hour of **inactivity**. Each request refreshes the timeout.

**Q: Can multiple people use the same session?**  
A: **Technically yes**, but **not recommended**. Each person should authenticate separately for security and audit trails.

**Q: What happens if someone steals my session ID?**  
A: They can access your Spotify account via SoulSpot. **Immediately logout** to revoke the session:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer STOLEN_SESSION_ID" \
     http://localhost:8000/api/auth/logout
```

**Q: Can I have multiple active sessions?**  
A: **Yes!** Each device/browser can have its own session. Or use the same session ID across all devices (less secure but more convenient).
