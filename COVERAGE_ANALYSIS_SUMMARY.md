## How to Use These Reports

### Step 1: Review the Coverage Report
```bash
cat TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md
```

### Step 2: Pick a Test to Implement
Start with `followed_artists_service.py` (0% coverage, highest priority)

### Step 3: Copy Test Code
Open `TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md` and copy the test for that file

### Step 4: Create Test File
```bash
# Create the test directory if needed
mkdir -p tests/unit/application/services

# Create the test file
vim tests/unit/application/services/test_followed_artists_service.py
# (paste the test code)
```

### Step 5: Run the Test
```bash
# Run just this test file
pytest tests/unit/application/services/test_followed_artists_service.py -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/unit/application/services/test_followed_artists_service.py \
  --cov=src/soulspot/application/services/followed_artists_service.py \
  --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Step 6: Verify Coverage Improved
```bash
# Run full coverage
make test-cov

# Check the HTML report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Step 7: Commit and Repeat
```bash
git add tests/
git commit -m "Add tests for followed_artists_service.py - increase coverage to 80%"
```

## Common Patterns in Suggested Tests

### 1. Testing Async Services
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_service(mock_dependency):
    service = MyService(mock_dependency)
    result = await service.do_something()
    assert result is not None
```

### 2. Testing API Endpoints
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_endpoint():
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:
        response = await client.get("/api/endpoint")
        assert response.status_code == 200
```

### 3. Testing Security (CSRF, etc.)
```python
async def test_csrf_protection():
    # Test with mismatched state
    response = await client.get("/callback", params={"state": "WRONG"})
    assert response.status_code == 400
    assert "CSRF" in response.json()["detail"]
```

### 4. Testing Error Handling
```python
async def test_handles_api_error(mock_client):
    mock_client.get.side_effect = Exception("API Error")
    result, stats = await service.sync()
    assert stats["errors"] > 0
```
