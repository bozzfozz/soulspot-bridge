# Hey future me - this is a merge migration that resolves multiple heads from two branches:
# - Branch 1: a0fbb3aff2a8 (earlier merge) -> c7da905f261a (add_image_url_to_artists)
#   Note: a0fbb3aff2a8 already merged session_persistence (40cac646364c) and genres_tags (dd18990ggh48)
# - Branch 2: dd18990ggh48 -> ee19001hhj49 -> ff20002ii50 -> gg20003jj51 -> hh21004kkl52 -> ii22005llm53
# Both branches ultimately trace back to dd18990ggh48, but one went through the earlier merge point.
# This created multiple heads, causing "alembic upgrade head" to fail. This merge brings them
# back into a single linear chain. No schema changes here - just dependency resolution.
# Both parent migrations must be applied before this one can run.
