    Hey future me - adding image_url as String(512) to store artist profile pictures from Spotify CDN.
    URLs typically look like: https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6761610000e5eb... (around 100-150 chars).
    Using 512 to be safe for future URL format changes. Field is nullable because not all artists
    have images, especially indie/underground artists. No index needed - we don't query by image_url.
    Existing artists will have NULL until next Spotify sync populates the data.
