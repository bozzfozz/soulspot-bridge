# Hey future me - this is a merge migration that resolves the branching issue where two
# independent migrations (40cac646364c for session persistence and dd18990ggh48 for artist
# genres/tags) both revised 0372f0c937d1. This created multiple heads in the migration
# history, causing "alembic upgrade head" to fail. This merge brings them back into a
# single linear chain. No schema changes here - just dependency resolution. Both parent
# migrations must be applied before this one can run. If you roll back past this point,
# you'll end up with the branch again - no problem, just specify which head to target.
